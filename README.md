This is an example to walkthrough a KiCAD to Blender workflow for creating renders of PCBs. I'm using Blender 2.81.16 and KiCAD (5.1.5)-3, but I don't think anything here is specific to these versions. The KiCAD file is pretty much entirely junk - nothing here is wired or routed up correctly like you would for an actual PCB.
